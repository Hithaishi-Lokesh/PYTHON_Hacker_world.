Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, .
Constraints

Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
Weird
Explanation 0
is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.
Sample Input 1

Explanation 1 and  is even, so it is not weird.


Solution
#!/bin/python3

import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys


def odd(num):
    if num % 2 != 0:
        return "Weird"
    else:
        return even(num)

def even(num):
    if 2 <= num <= 5:
        return "Not Weird"
    elif 6 <= num <= 20:
        return "Weird"
    elif num > 20:
        return "Not Weird"

N = int(input())
print(odd(N))
